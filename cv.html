     <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
     <p1>Toys R Us (September - Novemeber 2015)</p1>
     <p2>Position: Click & Collect</p2>
     <p>Roles & Experince: During my time at Toys R Us, I worked in the department known as Click & Collect, where customers would place an order online for a certain toy/item and I would then search the store's database to see if there were any of the items in stock. If there were, I would then print the order sheet out and serach for the items within the store or in storage and then place them in the Click & Collect area with the order sheet for when the customer would come and collect them. However, if the items were not in stock, I would then delete the order sheet and an automatic email would be sent to the customer explaining why their order has been cancelled.</p>
     <p1>3di Innovations Itd (July - September 2016)</p1>
     <p2>Position: Junior Administrator</p2>
     <p>Role & Experince: While working at 3di, I mainly handled the expenses of the CEO (my Dad) and the Director of Product and Services (my Step-Mother), which involved organizing the different recipts and tickets that possessed and documenting those figures within a spreadsheet file for them. Additionally, I help with the construction and maintenance with an Intranet meant for the company's staff to acces and navigate that held information relating to the company's top cilents and possessed information on all staff within the company. Finally, I also assisted with sorting out the different vendors on the company's Profiler database, checking to see which ones lack significant information and which ones possessed out-of-date news bulletins.</p>
     <h3>Skills and Personality</h3>
     <p>I am very presentable, hard-working, enthusiastiic, punctual and reliable. I learn quickly and very adaptable in a busy working environment. I take pride in having organisational skills and work well with both my peers and people in positions of authority. Previously, I have worked with the Student Council at my Secondary School for a while, I won a school chess tropghy and I achieved a Form Tutor Award during Year 11. Additionaly, I achieved the Key Stage 4 Award for Outstanding Attitude to Learning, I passed my Driver's Test and possess a full-fledged driving license. During my time at Oaklands during my 2 years on BTEC ICT Level 3, I learned and understood the programming language Javascript and used that knowledge to complete my assignments and create a small side-scroller shotter game for my Games Development module.</p>
     <h3>Activities</h3>
     <p>I like to draw and/or write up stories in my free time, I enjoy going on my computer and game consoles to play video games that interest me, and I am a good chess player. When I feel like it, I do enjoy reading a good book of fiction from time to time, and I attend an Archery Society in University on Thursday evenings. I did a martial arts known as Qui Kwan Do and acheived a Black Belt First Dan at the end of June 2015. I also have an enjoyment for listening to music when bored or to help me focus on my work.</p>
